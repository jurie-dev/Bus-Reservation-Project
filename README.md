# Bus-Reservation-Project
Developed a console-based bus reservation system using Java and JDBC to interact with a MySQL database.    Implemented core features such as viewing available buses, booking seats, and checking seat availability.    Followed the DAO design pattern to ensure modularity and clean separation between business logic and database operations.
